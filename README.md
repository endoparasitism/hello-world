# hello-world
This is my first ever repository, made for CTCH 310AD (University of Regina). I plan on using this to store and possibly share files. Thanks for your time and hello world!

My name is Darrek, I am a 4th Year Molecular Biology major at the U of R. I am taking this class to pick up some types and tricks for the coding I have been doing in my spare time. As a hobby, I am in the process of creating some very basic video games that I hope can one day actually become something productive. I am a science nerd by nature, but coding has always captured my attention greatly.
